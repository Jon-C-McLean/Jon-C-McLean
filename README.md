<h1>Hey, I'm Jon :wave:</h1>
I am a recent graduate of the <a href="https://uts.edu.au">University of Technology Sydney</a> where I studied a Bachelor of Engineering (Software) (Honours) and achieved first class honours. During my time at UTS I completed my honours thesis where I designed and evaluated a novel object detection and generative grasping model/system called YOLOCapNet-GGCNN. I specialise in embedded firmware development, high efficiency computer vision systems, "low resource" edge computing, and FPGA pipeline computer vision algorithms. 

Some projects that I am proud of are:
* [MultiLayer Perceptron](https://github.com/Jon-C-McLean/multilayer_perceptron) (built without Tensorflow, PyTorch, or other libraries)
* Honours Thesis: YOLOCapNet-GGCNN for Object Detection and Generative Grasping designed for use with a custom robotic arm. 
* [American Sign Language (Fingerspelling) Translator (custom model)](https://github.com/Jon-C-McLean/asl_fingerspelling)
* [UTS Rover Team](https://utsrovers.space)
* <a href="https://github.com/UTS-InterpolatURs">UTS InterpolatURs</a>
* [Optimus 2 Spacecraft](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/space-machines-company_activity-7170946514221981696-uPWI?utm_source=li_share&utm_content=feedcontent&utm_medium=g_dt_web&utm_campaign=copy): I was responsible for developing low level internal communication protocols as well as a custom ultra low power star tracker and engineering camera payload.
