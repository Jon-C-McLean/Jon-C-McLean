<h1>Hey, I'm Jon :wave:</h1>
I am a Software Engineering student at the <a href="https://uts.edu.au">University of Technology, Sydney</a>. I like to develop and participate in a wide variety of projects in my free time. Recently I have been working on building a lunar rover for ARC/URC as part of the UTS Rock-E Rover Team as well as developing a e-waste management robot for Robothon Grand Challenge 2022 as part of the <a href="https://github.com/UTS-InterpolatURs">UTS InterpolatURs</a> team.
