<h1>Hey, I'm Jon :wave:</h1>
I am a final year student at <a href="https://uts.edu.au">University of Technology, Sydney</a>. I specialise in machine learning and embedded firmware development. 

Recently I have been working a live American Sign Language (Fingerspelling) Translator as well as my honours thesis (YOLOCapNet-GGCNN). 

Some projects that I am proud of are:
* [MultiLayer Perceptron](https://github.com/Jon-C-McLean/multilayer_perceptron) (built without Tensorflow, PyTorch, or other libraries)
* Honours Thesis: YOLOCapNet-GGCNN for Object Detection and Generative Grasping designed for use with a custom robotic arm. 
* [American Sign Language (Fingerspelling) Translator (custom model)](https://github.com/Jon-C-McLean/asl_fingerspelling)
* UTS Rover Team
